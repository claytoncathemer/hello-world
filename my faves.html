        <h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
            <p>
                I love playing guitar. At times of high stress, its my way of escaping for a brief moment to clear my head. I play classical style, which is basically fingerstyle except with very old traditions dating back to the 1600s. Not only is it very soothing to hear and play but, it can get very complex and exciting creating an awesome challenge for my fingers and brain to work on. Currently, I have 3 guitars in my collection:
            <ul> 
            <li>my go-to Cordoba</li>
            <li>my Schecter</li>
            <li>my prized Gibson</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>
        When it comes to games, I love massive rpgs, shooter, and rts games. Some of my favorites are: 
        <ul>
            <li>The Witcher Series</li>
            <li>Skyrim</li> 
            <li>Borderlands 2</li>
            <li>Overwatch</li>
            <li>Age of Mythologies</li>
            <li>Starcraft 2</li>
            <li>Diablo 3</li>
        </ul>When it comes to games, the most important part in my opinion, is replayability. I love it when you can play a game over and over and have new things to explore, more levels to gain, and above all, <strong>LOOT</strong>!!! Loot is what makes my world go round when it comes to games. Every nook of every cave will be searched to ease my mind of leaving nothing behind!

    <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>
        Traveling is such a distant impossible dream to most, which is sad to me. There is so much rich history to see, beautiful sights to behold, experiences to have, and people to meet evrywhere around us. Sometimes in the towns we live near, or state neighboring us. Anyway you look at it, adventure is there so long as you seek it. My wife and I have sold everything to be able to travel for a year and it never ceases to amaze me at everything we've been blessed to see and photograph! Here is some sights we've captured:
